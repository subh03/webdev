# Semantic markup
it is the markup that relates to the meaning of content

We can classify all tags into :

- Semantic tags = tags which tell you its function
    
    eg - <h1>, <p>
    
- Non-semantic tags = tags which don’t tell you its function
    
    eg - <div>, <span>
    

semantic tags help : 
- make the code meaningful and structured layout 
- make SEO friendly 
- make the website more readable ; improve the user experience 

# Semantic tags

<header> </header>
<main> </main>
<footer> </footer>

<aside> </aside> - related links/content 

## HTML entities
It is a piece of text (”string”) that begins with an ampersand (&) and ends with a semicolon (;)

It is used to display reserved characters (which would otherwise be interpreted as HTML code) and invisible characters
(like non-breaking spaces)
can also use in place of characters that are difficult to type with a standard keyboard → like emojis 

browsers interpret them and render correct character 

space → &nbsp;
< → &lt;
> → &gt;
“ → &quot;
