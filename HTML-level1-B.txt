# Lists in HTML

## Unordered lists
eg -

- item 1
- item 2    → the items can be arranged anyway possible
- item 3
- .
- .

<ul>
	<li> Bread </li>
	<li> Butter </li>
	<li> Jam </li>
</ul>

<ul> → tag for unordered list 

## Ordered lists
eg - 

1. item 1 
2. item 2    → items are arranged in order 
3. item 3
4. .
5. .

<ol type="2">
	<li> Bread </li>
	<li> Butter </li>
	<li> Jam </li>
</ol>

<ol> → ordered list ; you can also specify the type of the ordered list

# HTML attributes
Attributes are used to add more information to the tag

<ol type="1"> → type="1" is the attribute 

# Anchor element

used to add links to your page 

<a href="https://google.com"> Google </a>

`href` → attribute (hypertext reference)

In the attribute → you can add 2 types of links

- absolute link = internet
- relative link = files
- 

# Image element

used to add image to the page 

<img src="image.png" alt="random image">

<img> is a single tag element 

src → can be relative or absolute url (to source the image that’s supposed to be shown)
alt → if there’s some issue with displaying the src image then this alt text will be shown describing what the image was 

the image and this code file should be in the same folder 

also there’s no content inside the tag only the attributes 

for an absolute link ; copy the image address of the image and paste it in the src attribute 

remember = once the image is deleted from online it won’t show in your website too which is not the case with relative url which takes the image from your folder 

# More HTML tags

## br tag
use to add next line (line break) to your page 

<p>twinkle twinkle <br> little star <br> how i wonder <br> what you are</p>

## bold, italic, underline tag

use to highlight text in your page 

<b> bold </b>
<i> italic </i>
<u> underline </u>

# Comments in HTML
this is the part of code which should not be parsed 

<!-- this is a HTML comment -->

they are generally for those who read the code and not for the browser 
you can highlight a line and type `cmd+/` to make it a comment and hide it from the browser

JS, Java, C++ are case sensitive languages
SQL, DB, HTMl are not case sensitive languages
