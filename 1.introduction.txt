# What is the internet?
Interconnected network of computers around the world

server = a special computer/system which is online 24/7 and is able to return data hassle-free all the time 
client = the machine asking for the data 

All the devices interconnected in the internet has a IP address  

CLIENT (request data) → ISP (internet service provider) → DNS (domain name system - dictionary)

Once the data is requested from ISP → it gives the request to DNS which has the IP addresses of all the servers → 
after getting the request DNS gives back the IP address of the requested domain to the ISP → ISP gives the IP address to the client
 → Now the client requests the domain directly using the given IP address 

# What is web development?
Building websites for the internet 

The client (website/system) requests the server for data → the server returns data in the form of packets of HTML, CSS, JS → 
the browser then get the data and gives us the website in display form (render)

HTML → structure 
CSS → style  
JS → functionality 

Frontend = HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap, Tailwind 
Backend = Express, NodeJS 
Database = SQL, MongoDB
