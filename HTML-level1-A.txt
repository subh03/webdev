# Introduction to HTML

HTML = hypertext markup language 
it tells the structure and formatting in a website 

formatting = representing texts in a better way instead of writing in a default single way - like including bullet points, bold, indentations and many more 

HTML tells the browser how to present the texts in the browser 

# HTML elements & tags

Standard elements that the browser recognises:

Paragraph = <p> abcd </p>

Heading = <h1> abcd </h1>

Image = 

The components used to design the structure of the website are called HTML tags → define the elements 

## HTML tags

a container for some content or other tags 


<p> abcd </p> 

<p> → opening tag
</p> → closing tag
abcd → content 

<p> abcd </p> → element 

# Hello world in HTML

<p>Hello world</p>
<p>subh</p>
<p><b>megs</b></p>


# Paragraph element
Paragraph element displays any content in a single line altogether. 

<p> This is my first paragraph</p> 
<p> This is my second paragraph</p>

<aside>
⭐ nesting = using tags inside tags and the tags are called tested tags

</aside>

# Heading element
The <h1> to <h6> are the six HTML elements to represent six levels of section heading. <h1> is the highest and <h6> is the lowest.

the headings have their own default size 

h1 will be printed in the same default size every time

# HTML Boilerplate
This is the standard format or the skeleton of writing HTML code 

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<title>My first page</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<p>Hello world</p>
	</body>
</html>


<!DOCTYPE html> → tells the version of HTML used (this is HTML 5)

<html> → root tag 
<head> → stores metadata (data about data)
<title> → its for the browser to find the website ; it’s not displayed on the website rather on the address bar 
<body> → data that are actually displayed on the website

html → head → title (hierarchical arrangement)
